Edo culture, Cultural period of Japanese history corresponding to the Tokugawa period of governance (1603–1867). Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first Tokugawa shogun, chose Edo (present-day Tokyo) as Japan’s new capital, and it became one of the largest cities of its time and was the site of a thriving urban culture. In literature, Basho developed poetic forms later called haiku, and Ihara Saikaku composed virtuoso comic linked-verse and humorous novels; in theatre, both kabuki (with live actors) and bunraku (with puppets) entertained townspeople (samurai, for whom theatregoing was forbidden, often attended in disguise). The development of polychrome woodblock printing techniques made it possible for ordinary people to obtain prints of popular kabuki actors or trendsetting courtesans (see ukiyo-e). Travelogues extolled the scenic beauty or historic interest of spots in distant provinces, and temple or shrine pilgrimages to distant places were popular. In scholarship, Kokugaku (“National Learning”) called attention to Japan’s most ancient poetry and oldest written histories. The study of Europe and its sciences, called rangaku, or “Dutch learning,” became popular despite extremely limited contact with Europe. Neo-Confucianism was also popular. See also Genroku period.
