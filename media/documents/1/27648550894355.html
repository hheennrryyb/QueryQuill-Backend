<p>SwimStraight™ is the first in-goggle compass for open water swimming. You can use it to sight your heading in open water and then follow the compass to swim in that direction. You should sight often to ensure that you are aware of your surroundings and that your heading remains true.</p>
<p>You can access SwimStraight™ through the goggles by selecting Open Water then choosing either to track on the goggles or with a watch. </p>
<p>If you have an active subscription, you will be invited to turn on SwimStraight™ before starting your swim. You cannot turn on SwimStraight™ once your swim has started. Likewise, you cannot turn it off during your swim.</p>
<p>If you select yes, you will then be guided through a calibration process. Please complete the calibration slowly to ensure the best chances of success. Once completed, you can start your swim. </p>
<p>To swim using SwimStraight™, look ahead at your destination. Note the bearing and then lower your head forward into the water. The bearings you see in the digital compass will be most accurate when your head is looking down in the water since this is how you will be swimming. Because of this, you may notice that the bearing changes slightly from being in the upright position to being flat in the water. Once you have your bearing, swim keeping that bearing in front of you.</p>
<p>You should be sighting (checking your heading and for any obstructions in your course) at least once every 20 seconds. The goggles will flash a message to remind you if no sighting is detected.</p>
<p>The goggles will reduce the compass movement as you roll to breathe to avoid the heading moving around too much during the breath cycle.</p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, you should spend 2-3 seconds per calibration step.</p>
<p>If the screen goes back to "Begin Calibration", it was likely too slow. Calibration times out after 19 seconds.</p>
<p>If the screen goes to "Almost there....", it was likely too quick.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HV2ER2YM3M0RN7THZFJY1TK6">Limitations</h2>
<p>Note that this feature is not available on any goggles where the serial number starts with J01 due to a change in hardware manufacturing that happened in 2019. </p>
