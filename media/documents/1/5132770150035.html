<h1>Vulnerability Disclosure Policy</h1>
<p>We take the security of our systems seriously, and we value the security community. The disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users.</p>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<li>Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us</li>
<li>Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and FORM until we’ve had 90 days to resolve the issue</li>

<ul>
<li>Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research</li>
<li>Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within 72 hours of submission)</li>
