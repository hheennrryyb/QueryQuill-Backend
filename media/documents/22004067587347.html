<h1>My goggles are fogging</h1>
<p>Your FORM goggles have the same chemical-resistant anti-fog that’s used in diving masks. In order to ensure this coating lasts for as long as possible, we recommend you avoid touching the inside of the lens.</p><p>If you store and clean your goggles properly from day one, this will prolong the life of the coating as much as possible.  </p><h2 id="h_01HC07X2V25NQMTN62281VSZ84">Storing the goggles</h2><p>The goggles should not be exposed to any extreme temperatures or left in direct sunlight. Do not take the goggles into saunas, steam rooms or hot tubs. Exposure to these environments may cause permanent damage. </p><p>We recommend using the case provided while carrying and storing, to protect the goggles from damage.</p><h2 id="h_01HC07X2V3S6FA43TVP81GA5JA">During your swim</h2><p>Fogging occurs when water vapor condenses on the goggle lens, due to the difference in temperature between the air inside the goggle lens and the temperature outside the goggle lens. The fog may clear by itself once the temperature difference has reduced. If not, you can dip the goggles in the pool to clear the lenses, as needed.</p><p>We recommend you do not push your goggles up onto your forehead when taking a break or swimming because sweat and heat can reduce the anti-fog effect.</p><h2 id="h_01HC07X2V33WP6NX0RXHN1VYTN">After every swim</h2><ol>
<li>Rinse goggles in fresh water after every swim</li>
<li>Store your goggles in their case after swimming to prevent scratches and, when convenient, open the case to allow the goggles to fully air dry.</li>
</ol><p>Chlorine, salt, and other pool chemicals will build up on the surface of the lens (and other goggle parts). Over time this will leave a film that can affect the performance of the anti-fog coating. The goggles should be stored in a dry environment to prevent moisture from degrading the anti-fog coating.</p><h2 id="h_01HC07X2V3VSFN8B5XYGBQTQ3K">Every four swims or as needed</h2><ol>
<li>Rinse the goggles in fresh, warm water</li>
<li>Apply a small amount of dish soap on your fingertip</li>
<li>Gently rub the eye seals, exterior of the goggles, and head strap. Do not touch the inside of the lens (it's okay if soap and water get inside)</li>
<li>Thoroughly rinse goggles</li>
<li>Add a small amount of dish soap to the inside of the goggle lens</li>
<li>Rinse the inside of the lenses with the tap on full pressure, until water runs clear (no more soap suds)</li>
<li>Repeat as necessary (step 6 may need to be repeated a few times)</li>
</ol><p>The eye seals and lenses will start to build up pool chemicals and debris that might not be easily rinsed away with freshwater. Eventually, mold can form if the goggles are not properly cared for.</p><h2 id="h_01HC07Y07D7M37BFA5RCQ5A62V">Anti-Fog Solutions</h2><p>We do not sell any anti-fog products, however, we have tested and approved the below for use with the goggles.
