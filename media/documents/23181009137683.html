<h1>How do I use HeadCoach™?</h1>
<p>HeadCoach™ is accessed through the goggles and through the app.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a Premium Feature and cannot be accessed without an active subscription.</li>
<li>Ensure your app and goggles are on the latest versions available to access new features and updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>When opening the app, you should see that you have a HeadCoach™ tab in the bottom right of the app. Tapping this will provide your coaching, scores and trends for each of the Skills.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HSEZAN61B252NESRD9HR92SC">Skills modes in the goggles</h2>
<p>HeadCoach™ Skills modes are in-goggle experiences which provide real-time feedback on your HeadCoach™ Skills while you're swimming. There are four ways to swim the Skill modes:</p>
<p>1. Add a HeadCoach™ Skill mode to your custom workout in the builder.</p>
<p>Adding a Skill mode to a subset in the workout builder will cause it to activate automatically when you swim that workout. </p>
<p>2. Select a workout from the FORM library that already has a HeadCoach™ Skill mode built in.</p>
<p>This means that, when swimming this workout, the Skill mode will activate automatically on the relevant subset(s).</p>
<p>3. Accept the suggestion to switch on a HeadCoach™ Skill mode during a free swim.</p>
<p>If you accept this suggestion at the beginning of a swim, during a rest, HeadCoach™ will suggest that you switch on a HeadCoach™ Skill mode. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>accept this suggestion, which will turn on that Skill mode until you wish to turn it off,</li>
<li>select "not now" which will mean that you may see a suggestion later in your swim, or</li>
<li>select "not this swim" which means you won't see anymore suggestions during this swim.</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Activate a HeadCoach™ Skill mode manually during a pool swim:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once you have started your swim, press the FRONT button to pause</li>
<li>Press the BACK button once till you see ‘HeadCoach™ Skills’ and press the FRONT button to select it</li>
<li>By default, the HeadCoach™ Skills will be ‘Off’, as noted by the checkmark</li>
<li>Use the BACK button to cycle through each of the skills</li>
<li>Press the FRONT button to select the skill you want to work on</li>
<li>Press the FRONT button again to ‘Resume Swim’</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01HSEY41VZYZ9DVYPTQHR7W6R1">Skills metrics in the goggles</h2>
<p>You can also add the Skills as metrics in your goggles' dashboard so that you can see your last length's score or value for each. You can see more about the metrics available and how to add them to your dashboard here:</p>
