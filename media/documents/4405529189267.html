<h1>Introduction to Workouts</h1>
<h2 id="h_01HAMPWAYPNG3FDXFEMD7FBQ2D" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">What is a Workout?</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">A workout is a guided activity in the pool. There are four types of workout:</p>
<ol>
<li>FORM's library of coach-built workouts: the workouts are built for many different purposes and with different intensity levels the swimmer can choose from. Each workout has a full description and explanation in the app. These could be standalone workouts, or part of a FORM plan.</li>
<li>HeadCoach™ workouts: generated by HeadCoach™ and personalized to you, based on your swimming history and focusing on where you need to make improvements. You can find out more <a href="https://support.formswim.com/hc/en-us/articles/23181009137683">here</a>.</li>
<li>Custom workouts built by the swimmer: the swimmer can make their own workouts for themselves or other people to swim. You can find out more about custom workouts <a href="https://support.formswim.com/hc/en-us/articles/8587038767251" target="_self">here</a>.</li>
<li>Imported workouts from TrainingPeaks. You can find out more <a href="https://support.formswim.com/hc/en-us/articles/18736716218515">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01HAMPWAYPJANB82CG5Y8A9H42" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">How do I read a FORM workout in the app?</h2>
<p>When you tap on a FORM workout in the app, you will see the name of the workout, the category, distance, estimated duration and intensity.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen, the button will show if the workout is already saved to your goggles or give you the option to save it. You can tap on the pencil icon to <a href="https://support.formswim.com/hc/en-us/articles/8587519844883" target="_self">edit the workout</a>.</p>
<p>You will also see a bookmark symbol in the top right corner. Bookmarking a workout does not save it to your goggles but adds it to your My Bookmarks list on the home tab.</p>
<p>The graph shows the stroke types, effort level and intervals.</p>
<p>Next, any recommended equipment is listed. Tapping on the piece of equipment will open a window with further information. Equipment is always optional.</p>
<p>If a HeadCoach™ Skill mode is set to automatically turn on during a subset or interval, it will also be indicated.</p>
<p>Lastly, each set of the workout is broken down and, in the case of workouts built by FORM, explained. These instructions will also be displayed in the goggles when swimming this workout.</p>
