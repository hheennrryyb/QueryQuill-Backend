<h1>How do I build my own custom workout?</h1>

<p>To start building your own workout, tap on Custom Workouts in the Workouts tab of the app. If you do not currently have any custom workouts created, you will see a yellow button inviting you to start building. You can also use the plus icon in the top right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>The next screen will allow you to start building your workout. A new workout starts with one empty set, to which at least one subset must be added before the workout can be saved. The empty set is Warm-Up but this can be changed by tapping the edit button to the right of the set name.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HSEXEEGMTDX6T2JN5V13P12M">Sets</h2>
<p>A workout contains one or more sets which, in turn, contain subsets. The list of possible sets can be found <a href="https://support.formswim.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405403523475" target="_self" rel="undefined">here</a>. Your workout does not need to contain all the types of sets, nor do the sets have to be in a specific order.</p>
<p>Editing the set will allow you to change the set type and the number of rounds. To delete a set, tap “edit” next to the set name and then scroll down to either duplicate or delete the set.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HSEXEEGMY6FES4DT9SSY2Z22">Subsets</h2>
<p>When adding a subset, you must first choose the number of intervals and the distance. If the distance is not divisible by 50, your workout can only be swum in a 25m/yds pool. Next, you will choose the stroke or drill type followed by the <a href="https://support.formswim.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405525009939" target="_self">effort level and type</a>. You can also make that subset a split effort or split stroke subset. This means that the subset can be split into two different strokes, drills or effort levels.</p>
<p>Below, you can select a HeadCoach™ Skill mode to add to your subset. This means that the Skill mode would activate automatically for that subset.</p>
<p>Lastly, you have the option to add up to three pieces of equipment to that subset. Once you are done, tap “save” to add the subset to the set.</p>
<p>Once you have more than one subset in a set, you can tap and drag on the subset line to change its position.</p>
<p>To edit, duplicate or delete a subset, you can tap on “edit” for that subset or tap and drag the subset line to the left to see the duplicate or delete options.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HSEXEEGN0JDVJ4AP388WCV25">Rounds</h2>
<p>A set can be programmed to be repeated a certain number of times (e.g. 2 rounds of the main set) by tapping the edit button to the right of the set name.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HSEXEEGNHZ1EBKW6W7VE6X31">Rests</h2>
<p>Rests are required between each interval, subset, set and round. You can select a rest time between 10 seconds and 1 minute 30 seconds. Note that this will be the recommended rest time shown in the goggles but, if you wish, you can start swimming before you see the word “go!” or you can rest as long as you need after the word “go!” has appeared on the screen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you build your workout, you will see the total distance for each set indicated underneath the set name, and the total distance for the entire workout so far at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>When you are done, tap “next” in the top right corner and enter a name for your workout. You can also select the intensity and category if you wish. Tap “save” to finish. Note that saving the workout does not automatically add it to your goggles. If you wish to add the workout to your goggles, tap on the workout once it’s saved and then “save to goggles”.</p>
